> ðŸ‡¦ No. The "strong" Fight or Flight window of <:supp:1255744841871134732><:sep:1255744841149710366><:hs:1008865707787825203> (1410p) compared to the "weak" Fight or Flight window of <:royal:1008865713282359437><:hs:1008865707787825203><:atone:1008865694718373990> (1350p) is only an extra 15 potency (we're only moving 60p from outside of Fight or Flight to inside, not creating potency overall, so the only gain is the Fight or Flight buff applied to that 60p, i.e. `60*0.25=15`). As a general rule, delaying <:fof:1008865719850647662> **Fight or Flight** and hardcasting <:hs:1008865707787825203> **Holy Spirit** are a much larger loss (average filler potency is `(220+330+440+440+460+480+470)/7 = ~405` while hardcast is ~340p taking into account the autos you lose from the auto-attack timer being paused during casts which translates to ~65p loss from hardcasting once). Encounter-specific considerations may cause one of these options to be correct but they will almost always be a loss.

> ðŸ‡¶ **Why should I spend the first <:atone:1008865694718373990> Atonement immediately after <:royal:1008865713282359437> Royal Authority, rather than holding it like before?**
> ðŸ‡¦ As long as you hold <:supp:1255744841871134732> **Supplication**, <:sep:1255744841149710366> **Sepulchre**, and <:divinemight:1062600918903828520>Divine Might <:hs:1008865707787825203> **Holy Spirit** as long as possible, you will still always have three strong fillers for <:fofbuff:1008882860981235764>**Fight or Flight**. Since Atonement isn't present in the "strong" Fight or Flight window of <:supp:1255744841871134732><:sep:1255744841149710366><:hs:1008865707787825203>, defaulting to spending the Atonement ASAP will cause the "strong" Fight or Flight window to occur more often.

> ðŸ‡¶ **Should I prioritize <:sep:1255744841149710366> Sepulchre or <:hs:1008865707787825203> Holy Spirit in <:fofbuff:1008882860981235764>Fight or Flight?**
> ðŸ‡¦ Sepulchre is 10p more than Holy Spirit, so when prioritize Sepulchre when possible. Sepulchre will only push Holy Spirit out of Fight or Flight if entering Fight or Flight immediately after <:royal:1008865713282359437> **Royal Authority**. If Royal Authority lands inside of Fight or Flight, there will not be enough extra GCD slots in Fight or Flight to fit all three of Atonement / Supplication / Sepulchre (<:atone:1008865694718373990><:supp:1255744841871134732><:sep:1255744841149710366>), so Holy Spirit will take precedence.
