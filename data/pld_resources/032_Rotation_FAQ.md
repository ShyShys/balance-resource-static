> ðŸ‡¶ **Why is hardcast <:hs:1008865707787825203> Holy Spirit not really 370 potency?**
> ðŸ‡¦ PLD auto-attacks are normalized to 90p every 3s, so with a 1 second cast time (1.5s tooltip cast time minus 0.5s slidecast window), auto-attacks are delayed by 1 second every hardcast. On average, **hardcast Holy Spirit is equivalent to 340 potency**. See `!faq castauto` in <#279387176502820865> for more info.

> ðŸ‡¶ **What GCD speed should I use?**
> ðŸ‡¦ 2.50 is usually ideal (see the *Best-in-slot* section).

> ðŸ‡¶ **How do I play with a faster GCD speed?**
> ðŸ‡¦ Depending on your speed, it may be possible to get 9 GCDs in <:fofbuff:1008882860981235764>**Fight or Flight** with tight execution and low latency, do this by weaving <:fof:1008865719850647662> **Fight or Flight** late in the GCD like so: <:lateweave:918961425890816040>. Since you are unable to double weave <:imperator:1255744838456971314> **Imperator** after a late-weaved Fight or Flight, you will also need to use <:goring:1008865704805671043> **Goring Blade** or another filler GCD immediately after Fight or Flight, then following it with Imperator into <:conf:1008865699436953760> **Confiteor** combo. Also depending on your speed, attempting to late-weave Fight or Flight every minute will result in large delays over time. At many non-2.5 speeds, you will end up alternating early- and late-weave Fight or Flights, and thus alternating between 8- and 9-GCD Fight or Flight windows.

> ðŸ‡¶ **Why 2.50 GCD?**
> ðŸ‡¦ A significant portion of Paladin's rotation is made up of spells, which aren't affected by Skill Speed, making the stat very inefficient compared to other substats. Outside of buffing <:cos:1008865717002698885> **Circle of Scorn**'s damage-over-time and auto-attacks, the effect of skill speed is encounter-specific and only results in gains if the filler GCD(s) that it gains outweighs the loss of other substats that buff all of your damage (including your high-damaging burst skills).

> ðŸ‡¶ **I have very high latency (100+ ms), what speed should I play?**
> ðŸ‡¦ Getting 9 GCDs in Fight or Flight is highly execution and latency dependent, on top of being worse than 2.50 in almost all cases. Use 2.50 and avoid double weaving if having trouble with clipping.
_ _
> ðŸ‡¶ **Spell Speed?**
> ðŸ‡¦ Spell Speed affects even less of the rotation than Skill Speed doesâ€”avoid.
