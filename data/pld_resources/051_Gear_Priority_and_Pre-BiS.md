Day 1 Savage prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use **XIVGear** (<https://xivgear.app/>) to make your own gearing decisions based on personal loot availability. Prioritizing item level over substats is encouraged while learning new encounters.

Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS. If a prog set is too fast for personal preference, it is usually best to simply play around it until better gear is available, instead of using lower item level gear to reach a preferred speed.

However, if progression gear does not provide enough skill speed for personal preference, it is recommended to meld skill speed (even if significant melding is needed) because this will allow for more consistent play without sacrificing primary stats.
