Listed speeds assume food is active. Speeds are primarily chosen for personal preference, due to differences in latency and execution, although certain (typically slower) speeds may be marginally better for certain encounters in optimization.

**The following gearsets are for Patch 7.0 - pre-savage.**

NOTE: These gearsets are pre-savage. These are provided primarily for completeness and it is not necessary or recommended to spend the materia on these unless actively trying to speedkill or parse high ranks, since these will immediately be superseded by crafted gear once savage releases.

**<:soup:1261066598324768809> 2.47 GCD — Vegetable Soup (7.0) — Direct-Hit-heavy**
> <https://etro.gg/gearset/a6b5492c-3745-4f08-b940-4f4e6be20918>

**<:jelly:1261066608374321205> 2.47 GCD — Fruit and Aloe Jelly (7.0) — Crit-heavy**
> <https://etro.gg/gearset/0170346f-a9d6-4154-86ba-596ccfd7cff6>

\*The two above sets perform within rounding error of each other. The crit-heavy set will perform marginally better with crit buffs like Scholar's Chain Stratagem and Dragoon's Battle Litany (Direct-hit buffs like Bard's Battle Voice affect both sets equally)
