Example set for The Epic of Alexander in patch 6.4 using i535 relic. These relic weapons are the most important items for Ultimate BiS, but are not required to simply clear the content.

**2.50 GCD â€” Baked Eggplant (6.4)  (The Epic of Alexander)**

> This gearset is a whopping ... 10 dps (less than 0.5%) better than just using crit+det gear at i595 or higher -- If you do not have the specific gear pieces already, it is highly recommended to not bother with them at all (the relic weapon itself is worth around 25 dps, but still not recommended if you have to grind it from scratch)
> Note: For the above set, you can use Aug. Deepshadow Necklace _instead of_ Edengrace Earring if desired.

Note that many other viable gear combinations exist, depending on personal gear availability and preferred GCD speed. The **Tank Gear Manager** (<https://bit.ly/XIV-TANKDPSCALC-EW>) may be used to make your own gearing decisions based on your own needs.
