Prepull shields and Toxikon generation are up to you and what the fight needs.

🔹 **Prepull Pneuma Opener**
This opener is situational and can gain you an extra gcd depending on kill time or phasing time, however it requires you to not need pneuma in the first two minutes of the fight. If people die or if healers are forced to gcd heal because of the missing pneuma you should not be using this opener.
