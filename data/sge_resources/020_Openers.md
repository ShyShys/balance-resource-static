Graphics to come later.

The 7.0 opener is the same as before, but with two changes:
- Psyche should be used during buffs
- In most compositions and fight lengths, you should refresh your DoT early during buffs

Some opener graphics were created prior to having full information, which showed Eukrasia Dyskrasia as being part of the opener. However, in the final Dawntrail release, Eukrasian Dyskrasia was changed to not stack with Eukrasian Dosis, so it should not be used in single-target scenarios.

The typical Sage opener for 7.0 will be the Toxikon opener, though the Pnuema opener is also an option.

## Why Toxikon/Pneuma?

Sage suffers from a weakness that other healers do not have, which is that its DoT has a longer effective delay due to needing to use Eukrasia first. If you open with Dosis, you will have a noticeable delay between your pre-pull Dosis and being able to apply your DoT. One solution to this is to use Pneuma, as it has the same cast time as Dosis, but allows you to pre-pull Eukrasia so that you can apply your DoT faster. In addition, this will shift all of your remaining GCDs up by about 1 second, potentially getting another GCD over the course of a fight.

Toxikon also achieves this, but through different means. Despite being an instant cast, it has a massive application delay, which helps reduce the time between your first instance of damage and applying your DoT.
