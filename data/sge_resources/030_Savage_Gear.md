**6.4 Savage Gear Sets**

Sets and approximate DPS comparison are available at https://xivgear.app/#/bis/sge/endwalker/anabaseios

**2.43 Relic Set Set** and **2.44 Relic Set**:
Two very similar sets with the new relic. They are within .1% DPS of each other - use whichever you feel gives you better movement and alignment.

**2.45 Base Piety Set:**  
Identical to WHM's 2.45. This is the overall best option for DPS if piety is not a concern.

**2.46 Mid Piety Set:**
This set is slightly slower and has more piety. This should fix any MP economy issues you may be having.

**2.47 Higher Piety Set:**
With even more piety and a slower GCD, this set should give you no problems with MP.

You can play around with the sets by clicking "Save As" under the table to make your own copy of the sheet.
