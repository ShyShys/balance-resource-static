<:toxikonII:916046239634706452> **Is Toxikon a dps gain?** <:toxikonII:916046239634706452>
Toxikon is dps neutral on one target at level 100 and a dps gain on 2+ targets if you already have a Toxikon charge. Using E.Diagnosis and then Toxikon is a loss on multiple targets compared to Dyskrasia.

<:kardia:916046239634698260> **Do DoT ticks proc Kardia?** <:kardia:916046239634698260>
No, Eukrasian Dosis only procs Kardia when you cast it, making its Kardia healing equivalent to your other damage GCDs.

<:pepsis:916046239529857044> **What is the purpose of Pepsis, will I be using it a lot?** <:pepsis:916046239529857044>
No, Pepsis is a utility button but not something you will be using as part of your healing rotation. It's a good way to clear shields if an incoming aoe needs it and your shields may fall off right before it happens. It is also possible to time it perfectly such that you "double dip" by using it in the short window between damage snapshotting and applying, which will cause you to benefit from both the shields and healing, but this is difficult to consistently time correctly and is risky.

<:eukrasiandosisIII:916046239601135646>  **Can I double weave after my DoT?** <:eukrasiandosisIII:916046239601135646>
No, Eukrasia has a 1s recast while the following spell has 1.5s recast time. You can only single weave after the second spell.
