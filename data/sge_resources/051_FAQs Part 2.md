<:phlegmaIII:916046239534022672>**How do I fit Phlegma into 2 minute buffs?**<:phlegmaIII:916046239534022672>
Now that the cooldown has been reduced from 45 seconds to 40 seconds in patch 6.3, fitting Phlegma into buffs is easy. Every two minutes, you'll receive three charges total. This allows you to put two of them into buffs, and use the third outside of buffs. Assuming your party is doing a normal opener and bursting every two minutes thereafter, you would use your first two charges as soon as raid buffs go up. The third charge is free to use anywhere from 0:40 to 2:00, and then you'll have two charges available at the next two minute window.

Yes! In fact, it is often the best usage of Zoe in most content. For ultimates and other fights that require large shields to survive mechanics, it can be used with <:eukrasianprognosis:916046239324340256> **Eukrasian Prognosis** to provide larger shields.
