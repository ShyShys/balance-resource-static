ðŸ”¹ **Why shouldnâ€™t I take double shield (SGE/SCH) in blind prog?** ðŸ”¹
Though double shield can be incredibly strong, itâ€™s likely not the best heal composition for entering and progging a fight fully blind. A double shield compositionâ€™s strength hinges on an understanding of the fightâ€™s damage timeline: if we know exactly when every instance of damage in a fight is, itâ€™s much easier to script a mitigation plan with two healers that can provide 19% mitigation every 30s. In blind prog, spam GCDs are crucial: if you donâ€™t understand a mechanicâ€™s damage profile, then you want to throw whatever you have at it in order to survive. Though SCHâ€™s Concitation and SGEâ€™s Eukrasian Prognosis III are both incredibly strong buttons by themselves, the overheal granted by the shields does not stack. As such, one instance of Concitation + E. Prog III provides 300 healing potency and a single additional 360p shield. Notably, this can make recovery before or after the damage instance more difficult, especially in a setting with several hits over an extended duration. Alternatively, one use of SCHâ€™s Concitation with ASTâ€™s Helios Conjunction can provide 450 healing potency, a 360p shield, and an 875p party regen.

ðŸ”¹ **With the updates to Sage and Scholar, isnâ€™t double shield broken?** ðŸ”¹
To some extent! The two jobs by themselves are incredibly useful in any heal composition. While Seraphism allows SCH to spam high-potency pure heals due to the quick cooldown on Emergency Tactics while the skill is active, itâ€™s on a 3 minute cooldown and not something thatâ€™s readily available. Additionally, getting maximum value out of it depends on you and your cohealer knowing the fightâ€™s timeline.
